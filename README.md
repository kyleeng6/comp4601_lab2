What I installed?
- npm install mongodb
- npm install express
- npm install pug

To Run:
- npm install
- npm start

MongoDB Semantics
- Navigate to Working Directory (Server Folder)
- Run mongod --dbpath products/L2-DB
	- make sure L2-DB (a directory) is created before running the cmd.
- Use "mongodb": "^4.9.1"
	- for some reason version 6.1.0 did not work and I couldn't connect to the database.
- Connected at 127.0.0.1


1. Discuss the collections and documents that you store in the database (e.g., what data are you storing about products, orders, etc.).
	Products

	Orders
	

2. What is the structure of your new order data? How is it sent to the server (e.g., through an HTML form, JSON request)?



3. How do you load the data for a specific order so it can be displayed to the user?
